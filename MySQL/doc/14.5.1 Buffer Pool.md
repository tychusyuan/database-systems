# 14.5.1 Buffer Pool
The buffer pool is an area in main memory where InnoDB caches table and index data as it is accessed. The buffer pool permits frequently used data to be accessed directly from memory, which speeds up processing. On dedicated servers, up to 80% of physical memory is often assigned to the buffer pool.

For efficiency of high-volume read operations, the buffer pool is divided into pages that can potentially hold multiple rows. For efficiency of cache management, the buffer pool is implemented as a linked list of pages; data that is rarely used is aged out of the cache using a variation of the least recently used (LRU) algorithm.

Knowing how to take advantage of the buffer pool to keep frequently accessed data in memory is an important aspect of MySQL tuning.

Buffer Pool LRU Algorithm
The buffer pool is managed as a list using a variation of the LRU algorithm. When room is needed to add a new page to the buffer pool, the least recently used page is evicted and a new page is added to the middle of the list. This midpoint insertion strategy treats the list as two sublists:

At the head, a sublist of new (“young”) pages that were accessed recently

At the tail, a sublist of old pages that were accessed less recently

The algorithm keeps frequently used pages in the new sublist. The old sublist contains less frequently used pages; these pages are candidates for eviction.

By default, the algorithm operates as follows:

3/8 of the buffer pool is devoted to the old sublist.

The midpoint of the list is the boundary where the tail of the new sublist meets the head of the old sublist.

When InnoDB reads a page into the buffer pool, it initially inserts it at the midpoint (the head of the old sublist). A page can be read because it is required for a user-initiated operation such as an SQL query, or as part of a read-ahead operation performed automatically by InnoDB.

Accessing a page in the old sublist makes it “young”, moving it to the head of the new sublist. If the page was read because it was required by a user-initiated operation, the first access occurs immediately and the page is made young. If the page was read due to a read-ahead operation, the first access does not occur immediately and might not occur at all before the page is evicted.

As the database operates, pages in the buffer pool that are not accessed “age” by moving toward the tail of the list. Pages in both the new and old sublists age as other pages are made new. Pages in the old sublist also age as pages are inserted at the midpoint. Eventually, a page that remains unused reaches the tail of the old sublist and is evicted.

By default, pages read by queries are immediately moved into the new sublist, meaning they stay in the buffer pool longer. A table scan, performed for a mysqldump operation or a SELECT statement with no WHERE clause, for example, can bring a large amount of data into the buffer pool and evict an equivalent amount of older data, even if the new data is never used again. Similarly, pages that are loaded by the read-ahead background thread and accessed only once are moved to the head of the new list. These situations can push frequently used pages to the old sublist where they become subject to eviction. For information about optimizing this behavior, see Section 14.8.3.3, “Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant”, and Section 14.8.3.4, “Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Prefetching (Read-Ahead)”.

InnoDB Standard Monitor output contains several fields in the BUFFER POOL AND MEMORY section regarding operation of the buffer pool LRU algorithm. For details, see Monitoring the Buffer Pool Using the InnoDB Standard Monitor.

Buffer Pool Configuration
You can configure the various aspects of the buffer pool to improve performance.

Ideally, you set the size of the buffer pool to as large a value as practical, leaving enough memory for other processes on the server to run without excessive paging. The larger the buffer pool, the more InnoDB acts like an in-memory database, reading data from disk once and then accessing the data from memory during subsequent reads. See Section 14.8.3.1, “Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Size”.

On 64-bit systems with sufficient memory, you can split the buffer pool into multiple parts to minimize contention for memory structures among concurrent operations. For details, see Section 14.8.3.2, “Configuring Multiple Buffer Pool Instances”.

You can keep frequently accessed data in memory regardless of sudden spikes of activity from operations that would bring large amounts of infrequently accessed data into the buffer pool. For details, see Section 14.8.3.3, “Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant”.

You can control how and when to perform read-ahead requests to prefetch pages into the buffer pool asynchronously in anticipation that the pages are needed soon. For details, see Section 14.8.3.4, “Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Prefetching (Read-Ahead)”.

You can control when background flushing occurs and whether or not the rate of flushing is dynamically adjusted based on workload. For details, see Section 14.8.3.5, “Configuring Buffer Pool Flushing”.

You can configure how InnoDB preserves the current buffer pool state to avoid a lengthy warmup period after a server restart. For details, see Section 14.8.3.6, “Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State”.

Notes:

The youngs/s metric is applicable only to old pages. It is based on the number of page accesses. There can be multiple accesses for a given page, all of which are counted. If you see very low youngs/s values when there are no large scans occurring, consider reducing the delay time or increasing the percentage of the buffer pool used for the old sublist. Increasing the percentage makes the old sublist larger so that it takes longer for pages in that sublist to move to the tail, which increases the likelihood that those pages are accessed again and made young. See Section 14.8.3.3, “Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant”.

The non-youngs/s metric is applicable only to old pages. It is based on the number of page accesses. There can be multiple accesses for a given page, all of which are counted. If you do not see a higher non-youngs/s value when performing large table scans (and a higher youngs/s value), increase the delay value. See Section 14.8.3.3, “Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant”.

The young-making rate accounts for all buffer pool page accesses, not just accesses for pages in the old sublist. The young-making rate and not rate do not normally add up to the overall buffer pool hit rate. Page hits in the old sublist cause pages to move to the new sublist, but page hits in the new sublist cause pages to move to the head of the list only if they are a certain distance from the head.

not (young-making rate) is the average hit rate at which page accesses have not resulted in making pages young due to the delay defined by innodb_old_blocks_time not being met, or due to page hits in the new sublist that did not result in pages being moved to the head. This rate accounts for all buffer pool page accesses, not just accesses for pages in the old sublist.

Buffer pool server status variables and the INNODB_BUFFER_POOL_STATS table provide many of the same buffer pool metrics found in InnoDB Standard Monitor output. For more information, see Example 14.10, “Querying the INNODB_BUFFER_POOL_STATS Table”.
